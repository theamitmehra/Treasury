# Introduction

A popular definition of **machine learning** due to Tom Mitchell is as follows :

>[!quote] Tom Mitchell
>A Computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$, and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.

In this repository we cover ML from a **probabilistic perspective**, this means that we treat all unknown quantities as **random variables**, that are endowed with **probability distributions** which describe a weighted set of possible values the variable may have .
