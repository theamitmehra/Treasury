### Problems 
#### Points of maximum overlap
##### a. Proving the Existence of a Maximum Overlap at an Endpoint

###### Claim:
There is always a point of maximum overlap that is an **endpoint** of one of the intervals.
###### Proof:
1. Consider a set of intervals on a number line.
2. As we traverse along the number line, intervals can start and end at their respective endpoints.
3. The overlap count only changes at the endpoints of intervals:
    - When we reach the **left endpoint** of an interval, the overlap count **increases**.
    - When we reach the **right endpoint**, the overlap count **decreases**.
4. Between any two consecutive endpoints, the overlap count remains constant.
5. Thus, the point of maximum overlap must be an endpoint of one or more intervals since no other points (between endpoints) can change the overlap count.
Therefore, the maximum overlap always occurs at one of the endpoints.
---
##### b. Data Structure Design for Interval Operations
We will design a **balanced binary search tree** (red-black tree) to store all interval endpoints. Each node in the tree will represent an endpoint and store additional information to efficiently track the point of maximum overlap.
###### Key Operations:
- `INTERVAL-INSERT([a, b])`: Insert an interval $[a,b]$ into the data structure.
- `INTERVAL-DELETE([a, b])`: Delete an interval $[a,b]$ from the data structure.
- `FIND-POM()`: Return the point of maximum overlap.

###### Data Structure:
- Use a **red-black tree** to maintain all interval endpoints.
- Each node represents an endpoint (either aaa or bbb) and stores:
    - `key`: The value of the endpoint.
    - `count`: A value of +1 if it's a left endpoint, -1 if it's a right endpoint.
    - `prefix_sum`: The running sum of counts in the tree up to the current node.
    - `max_overlap`: The maximum overlap found in the subtree rooted at this node.
    - `max_overlap_point`: The point in the subtree where the maximum overlap occurs.
    - `left`, `right`, `parent`: Standard red-black tree pointers for children and parent nodes.
###### Operations:
1. `INTERVAL-INSERT([a, b])`
	- Insert two nodes into the red-black tree:
	    - One for aaa with `count = +1`.
	    - One for bbb with `count = -1`.
	- Update the `prefix_sum` and `max_overlap` values during insertion.
2. `INTERVAL-DELETE([a, b])`
	- Remove the nodes corresponding to a and b from the tree.
	- Adjust the `prefix_sum` and `max_overlap` values accordingly.
3. `FIND-POM()`
	- Return the `max_overlap_point` stored at the root of the tree, which represents the point of maximum overlap.

###### Pseudocode: 

```
INTERVAL-INSERT(T, [a, b]):
    RB-INSERT(T, a, +1)  // Insert left endpoint with +1
    RB-INSERT(T, b, -1)  // Insert right endpoint with -1
    UPDATE-COUNTS-AND-MAX(T, a)
    UPDATE-COUNTS-AND-MAX(T, b)
```

```
INTERVAL-DELETE(T, [a, b]):
    RB-DELETE(T, a)  // Remove left endpoint
    RB-DELETE(T, b)  // Remove right endpoint
    UPDATE-COUNTS-AND-MAX(T, a)
    UPDATE-COUNTS-AND-MAX(T, b)
```

```
FIND-POM(T):
    return T.root.max_overlap_point
```

```
UPDATE-COUNTS-AND-MAX(T, node):
    while node â‰  NIL:
        node.prefix_sum = node.left.prefix_sum + node.count + node.right.prefix_sum
        left_max = node.left.max_overlap
        right_max = node.right.max_overlap

        node.max_overlap = max(left_max, node.prefix_sum, right_max)

        if node.max_overlap == left_max:
            node.max_overlap_point = node.left.max_overlap_point
        elif node.max_overlap == node.prefix_sum:
            node.max_overlap_point = node.key  // This node's endpoint
        else:
            node.max_overlap_point = node.right.max_overlap_point

        node = node.parent
```
###### Time Complexity:
- `INTERVAL-INSERT` : $O(\log n)$
- `INTERVAL-DELETE` : $O(\log n)$
- `FIND-POM` : $O(1)$

This design efficiently supports the required operations while maintaining the point of maximum overlap.

#### Josephus permutation
We define the Josephus problem as follows. A group of $n$ people form a circle, and we are given a positive integer $m \leq n$. Beginning with a designated first person, proceed around the circle, removing every $m$th person. After each person is removed, counting continues around the circle that remains. This process continues until nobody remains in the circle. The order in which the people are removed from the circle defines the  (n, m) Josephus permutation of the integers $1,2,\dots,n$. For example, the . $(7,3)$-Josephus permutation is $\langle 3,6,2,7,5,1,4\rangle$

- Suppose that $m$ is a constant. Describe an $O(n)$ time algorithm that, given an integer $n$, outputs the $(n,m)$-Josephus permutation. 
- Suppose that $m$ is not necessarily a constant. Describe an $O(n \lg n)$ time algorithm that, given integers $n$ and $m$, outputs the $(n,m)$-Josephus permutation.

##### Josephus Problem with Constant \(m\)
###### Approach
- We use a circular linked list to simulate the removal process.
- Start with a list of \(n\) people, and remove every \(m\)-th person.
- This can be done in \(O(n)\) time as we traverse the list once.
###### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a circular linked list with people \(1\) to \(n\).
2. Set a pointer to the first person.
3. Move the pointer \(m - 1\) times to find the \(m\)-th person.
4. Remove that person from the list.
5. Continue until the list is empty.
###### Pseudocode:

```plaintext
JOSEPHUS-CONSTANT-M(n, m):
    Initialize a circular linked list L with elements 1 to n
    result = []
    current = 1  // Start from the first person

    while L is not empty:
        Move the pointer m-1 steps forward in the list
        Remove the current person from the list
        Add the removed person to the result
        Set the pointer to the next person

    return result  // The Josephus permutation
```

###### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: \(O(n)\), as each removal takes constant time, and we perform \(n\) removals.
---
##### b. Josephus Problem with Arbitrary \(m\)
###### Approach:
- To achieve \(O(n \log n)\), we use a **segment tree** or a **balanced binary search tree** to efficiently manage the circle of people.
- In this case, we can maintain a set of remaining people and use the structure to efficiently find and remove the \(m\)-th person.
###### Algorithm:
1. Build a segment tree or balanced BST of size \(n\), where each node stores the number of remaining people.
2. Start counting and find the \(m\)-th person to be removed by querying the tree.
3. After removing the person, update the tree to reflect the removal.
4. Repeat until all people are removed
###### Pseudocode:
```plaintext
JOSEPHUS-GENERAL-M(n, m):
    Initialize a segment tree T with 1 at all positions (size n)
    result = []
    current = 1  // Start from the first person
    remaining = n

    while remaining > 0:
        Find the m-th person by querying the segment tree T
        Remove the person from the tree and update the segment tree
        Add the removed person to the result
        remaining = remaining - 1

    return result  // The Josephus permutation
```
###### Explanation:
- The segment tree helps us efficiently find the \(m\)-th person in \(O(\log n)\) time.
- After each removal, we update the tree in \(O(\log n)\) time.
- The total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to \(n\) removals, each taking \(O(\log n)\).
###### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), as each removal and update operation takes \(O(\log n)\), and we perform \(n\) removals.
