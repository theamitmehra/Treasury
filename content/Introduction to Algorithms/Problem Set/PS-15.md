Chapter Notes
Much more material on greedy algorithms can be found in `Lawler` and `Papadimitriou` and `Stieglitz` . The greedy algorithm first appeared in the combinatorial optimization literature in a 1971 article by `Edmonds` . The proof of correctness of the greedy algorithm for the activity-selection problem is based on that of `Gavril`. Huffman codes were invented in 1952 . `Lelewer` and `Hirschberg`  surveys data-compression techniques known as of 1987. The furthest-in-future strategy was proposed by `Belady` , who suggested it for virtual-memory systems. Alternative proofs that furthest-in-future is optimal appear in articles by `Lee` et al. and `Van Roy` .
